Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository is compiled for the course project of the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course at Coursera. This README document provides information on the repo, as follows:

Project Summary:

The purpose of this project focuses on the source data (Human Activity Recognition using Smartphones) and prepares tidy data for further analysis. The steps carried out in the project are highlighted as follows.


A R script called run_analysis.R is created that does the following. 

1.) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2.) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

3.) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4.) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

5.) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


Dataset:

Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones
Source data:   https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip  

Files:

CodeBook.md a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data

run_analysis.R performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the project description above. 

tidy_data_set.txt provides the output of run_analysis.R
